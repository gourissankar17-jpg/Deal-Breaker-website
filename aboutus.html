  <h1><font color="#ffcc00">About Deal Breaker</font></h1>
  <br>

  <h2><font color="#ffa500">1. What is Deal Breaker?</font></h2>
  <p>Deal Breaker is a student-built price comparison platform that helps users find the best deals across online stores like Amazon and Flipkart.<br>
  Instead of juggling tabs and hunting for discounts, users get a clean, focused view of top products and prices—all in one place.</p>
  <br>

  <h2><font color="#ffa500">2. Why Did We Build It?</font></h2>
  <p>Born out of a semester project, Deal Breaker tackles a real-world problem: price hunting fatigue.<br>
  We wanted to create something practical, intuitive, and genuinely helpful—while sharpening our web development skills in the process.</p>
  <br>

  <h2><font color="#ffa500">3. How Does It Work?</font></h2>
  <p>Currently, Deal Breaker is a static site that showcases prices for selected products from Amazon and Flipkart.<br>
  Each product card includes platform-specific pricing and direct “Buy Now” links.<br>
  It simulates the experience of a real-time comparison engine, with plans to evolve.</p>
  <br>

  <h2><font color="#ffa500">4. Who Is It For?</font></h2>
  <p>Students, gamers, budget-conscious buyers—anyone who wants to shop smarter without wasting time.<br>
  Deal Breaker is built for everyday users who value clarity, speed, and savings.</p>
  <br>

  <h2><font color="#ffa500">5. What’s Next?</font></h2>
  <p><em>As of now, Deal Breaker is a learning project.<br>
  But we’re dreaming bigger: real-time price tracking, expanded product categories, and interactive features that make deal hunting fun and effortless.</em></p>
